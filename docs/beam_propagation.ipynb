    "## Paraxial wave equation\n",
    "When a cw laser propagates along $z$ in a medium where the refractive index $ n(x) $ varies transversaly (e.g. a waveguide), the evolution of the 1D optical field envelop $A(x, z)$ is described by the following paraxial wave equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial A(x, z)}{\\partial z} = \\frac{i}{2k} \\frac{\\partial^2 A}{\\partial x^2} - i k \\Delta n(x) A\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $ A(x, z) $ is the complex field envelope,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ k = 2\\pi n_0 / \\lambda $ is the wavenumber with $ n_0 $ the refractive index of the medium and $\\lambda$ the laser wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ \\Delta n(x) = n(x) - n_0 $ is the transverse refractive index modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fisrt r.h.s term corresponds to the diffraction and the second to the refractive index modulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Split-step Fourier method\n",
    "\n",
    "To numerically solve this equation, the evolution is splitted at each propagation step $\\Delta z$ into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diffraction (solved in Fourier space):\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Perform FFT of $ A(x, z) \\rightarrow \\tilde{A}(k_x, z) $\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Apply the diffraction operator in Fourier space:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\tilde{A}(k_x, z+\\Delta z) = \\tilde{A}(k_x, z) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{k_x^2}{2k} \\cdot \\Delta z \\right)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Inverse FFT back to real space, $\\tilde{A}(k_x, z+\\Delta z) \\rightarrow A(x, z+\\Delta z) $\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refractive index modulation (solved in real space)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(x, z + \\Delta z) = A(x, z+\\Delta z) \\cdot \\exp\\left(i k \\Delta n(x) \\cdot \\Delta z \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated step-by-step along the propagation axis $ z $.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to study the propagation of an input *gaussian* laser with variable waist $w_0$ in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* free space (i.e. in an homogeneous medium) to illustrate \n",
    "\n",
    "* a single gaussian-shaped waveguide with varying parameters (size, maximum index variation) to illustrate single and multimode propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "* a directionnal coupler (made of two straight waveguides) to illustrate the evancescent coupling discussed in the mini project #2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical output is illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/proj_split_step.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you have to code a class for the numerical calculation and then make a GUI using NiceGUI with variable parameters (like input beam, refractive index distribution, output visualization, etc.). Please note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a group project (**4 people max**), you have to organize your work accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each group have to track his project on Github (in the OPTIQ25 organisation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The deadline to finalize your project on Github is **Thursday November 13th, 2:00pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will have present your work (10 min + 5 min for questions) on **Friday November 14th, 2025**. In your presentation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Explain how you manage the project (who did what?)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Review your code and run your NiceGUI App live\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Comment the case studies discussed above by varying the physical parameters"
