# Python programming for photonics



### Objectives
The goal of this lecture is to give you an introduction to Python programming for photonics. At the end of the course, you are supposed to acquire few important skills:
*  Use Python to process data/images from optical experiments
*  Use Python to simulate optical systems (numerical computing methods will not be detailed)
*  Use Python to interact with your experimental devices via graphical user interfaces.

### Prerequisites
* Basic Python/programmation and optics knowledges
* Don't be allergic to lines of code!
* **Before the first class** make sure that [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) and [VSCode](https://vscode.github.com) are properly installed on your PC and up-to-date. Please subscribe to a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and send me your username.




## Resources

### Old school way
* Official Python and specific packages documentation
* Web search!

### AI policy
* AI tools can assist you to code efficiently but you should first learn the programming language to maintain a critical perspective 
* Note that this course is not intended to teach you how to use AI tools.

**Keep in mind that this isn’t a comprehensive tutorial and you don’t need to memorize every detail by heart! The goal is to give you enough insight to guide you towards the resources you’ll need to build and improve your code project.**
